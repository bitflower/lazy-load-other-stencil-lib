# Loading another Stencil lib lazily (without bundling)

Proof of concept :white_check_mark:

I think we should be sensitive to the fact that this uses ES module (if that is what index.es2017.js provides).

## Live demo

[Here](https://lazy-load-other-stencil-lib-de9j.vercel.app/profile/stencil).

## Getting Started

To run the project, clone this repo to a new directory:

then run:

```bash
npm start
```

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests once, run:

```
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```
npm run test.watch
```
